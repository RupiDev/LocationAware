# LocationAware
This app show you a map of your current location, and it will give you information based on your 
current location. This app uses reverse geolocation, to get your current address and other information


## Description
Again this app shows you a map of your current location and it will give your information based on your current location.
This map in the app follows your current location and displays information based on the current location and the phone movement.
The map will follow wherever you go, so as you move the map will update. The information dispayed to the user is the direction
you are headed, the latitude, the longitude, altitude, and the speed. The app also uses reverse geolocation to return the current
user's address. Unfortunately current location doesn't work on the simulator, so I can't display this app in this read me.
